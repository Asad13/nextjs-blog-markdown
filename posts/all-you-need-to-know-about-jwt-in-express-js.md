JWT is a JSON Web Token that is used to transfer data
<!-- end -->
JWT is a JSON Web Token that is used to transfer data to someone over the internet with encryption. This helps to maintain the secrecy between the two parties.

## What Is JSON Web Token?

- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that provides a compressed and independent method for secure data transfer among parties as a JSON object. 
- It can be used for information exchange and is commonly used for authentication systems.
- JWT is widely used for HTTP-based authentication and authorization. These tokens can be used as login information to give access to the server.
- The size of JWT is very compact and can be transmitted by an HTTP header, POST parameter, or URL. Also, because of its size, its transmission is fast.
- JWT requires user information in the self-contained Payload not to contact the Database repeatedly.

## JSON Web Token Structure

JWTs contain three sections that are separated by dots (.), which are as follows:
- Header: The header typically consists of two parts, and JWT is the type of token that uses a signing algorithm, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
- Payload: The second one is Payload. It is a statement in which Claims are assertions about an entity (usually the user) and other data. Claims can be classified as registered, public, or private. The Payload contains the JSON object or the claim.
- Signature: A signature is a cryptographic algorithm used to verify the integrity of the JSON payload. To create a signature, you must sign the encoded header, encoded Payload, secret, and algorithm indicated in the header and mark that.

## JWT Use Cases

Authorization - This is the most common structure for using JWT. When registered, the user can access routes, services, and resources authorized with that token by including the JWT in subsequent requests.
Information Exchange - With the help of JSON Web Tokens, you can securely transmit information between parties.
