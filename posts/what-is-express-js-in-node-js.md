Node JS is a fast JavaScript runtime environment
<!-- end -->
Node JS is a fast JavaScript runtime environment that we use to build server-side applications, but it does not know how to perform serving files, handling requests, and handling HTTP methods, so this is where express js comes in.

Express JS is a Node.js framework designed to build API's web applications cross-platform mobile apps quickly and make node js easy.

## What Is Express JS?

Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

## Why Express JS?

- Express was created to make APIs and web applications with ease,
- It saves a lot of coding time almost by half and still makes web and 
mobile applications are efficient.
- Another reason for using express is that it is written in javascript as javascript is an easy language even if you don't have a previous
- knowledge of any language. Express lets so many new developers enter the field of web development.

The reason behind creating an express framework for node js is:
- Time-efficient
- Fast 
- Economical
- Easy to learn
- Asynchronous

## Features of Express JS

-Fast Server-Side Development 
The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

-Middleware
Middleware is a request handler that has access to the application's request-response cycle.

-Routing 
It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

-Templating 
It provides templating engines to build dynamic content on the web pages by creating HTML templates on the server.

-Debugging 
Express makes it easier as it identifies the exact part where bugs are.

## Advantages of Using Express With Node.js

- Express is Unopinionated, and we can customize it.
- For request handling, we can use Middleware.
- A single language is used for frontend and backend development.
- Express is fast to link it with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
​- ​Express allows dynamic rendering of HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.

## Limitations of Express JS

Sometimes, there is no structural way to organize things, and the code becomes non-understandable.
There are so many issues with callbacks.
The error messages that will come are challenging to understand.

## Companies That Are Using Express JS

- Netflix 
- IBM 
- ebay
- Uber
