Thinking of switching gears into app development?

Thinking of switching gears into app development? The demand for skilled and talented mobile app developers continues to exceed supply by quite some margin. It’s a lucrative field to build a career in, but before you get started, it’s important to find the answer to a critical question: which platform do you specialize in?

Android and iOS reign supreme among the mobile application platforms of choice for app developers.
And so, having to decide between the two – iOS and Android app development – can be bewildering if you are just setting out. We’ll help you with some basic facts to ease your decision-making process. See what suits you best.

First, we will begin by comparing and contrasting the two operating systems themselves, and then compare the upsides and downsides to app development with Android and iOS.

Now, let the battle begin!

## Battle of the Operating Systems:  Android Vs iOS

Android: For you, as a prospective newbie in mobile app development, Android’s single biggest selling point is its customizability. Android’s open-source model has paved the way for third-party developers to create a wide range of apps and add-on functionalities that add to the OS’s inherent capabilities.

You can create and develop anything from widgets and live wallpapers to apps that can be downloaded from not only the Google Play Store but also from the Amazon Appstore or even directly from the app developer’s website.

This leaves developers with a greater scope for testing the waters in Android app development and to create striking apps that find great usability.  

## Android Platform

### Some Pros:
-Android’s customization possibilities include the ability to install multiple gadgets and widgets to a device’s lock system.
- Ability to set or change specific programs is made possible.
- You can install non-factory dialers and SMS apps.
- The standard pull-down notification system allows you to turn Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and audio on and off with a single tap instead of having to access system preferences.
- By default, Android also has a file management system similar to PCs and Macs that delivers a “hands on” experience to using the mobile devices.

### Some Cons:
- Freedom to customize does not guarantee uniform performance of the interface.

For instance, something that was intended to perform well in a particular OS may not perform so well with an upgraded OS.

- Also, Google’s app policies aren’t as strict as those of Apple’s, meaning apps do not have guaranteed peak performance rates and there is also the risk of security threats.

Despite its flaws, Android remains the more popular and widely-used among the two operating systems, and more mobile manufacturers use the Android OS than any other.

iOS: Whatever Android lacks, iOS compensates for. With its simplistic layout and vibrant colors, the Apple interface ensures uniformity and consistency of performance.

Many newly released apps, too, mostly enter the Apple App Store before finding their way into the Google Play Store or onto the Android market. This is more so because of the credibility that iOS applications seem to guarantee. The strict quality control measures taken by Apple ensure greater security, unlike the case with Android.

## iOS Platform

### Some pros:
- It is quick, clean, and a lot more secure than most other platforms available on the market.
- Greater legitimacy and security of applications is assured.
- It is more stable and has a user-friendly mobile interface.
- iOS’s interface lends itself better to gaming and game developers.

Most often, the advantageous and disadvantageous factors of iOS overlap. Consider the following -

### Some cons:

- Apple does not allow Flash functionality.
- Sideloading of apps is not possible with the iOS. And although jail-breaking is an option to overcome this, it might further result in reduced device operability.
- Although secure, iOS restricts the freedom for users to explore a greater variety of apps.

Thus, it might be said while both the operating systems have their own sets of pros and cons, and perform similarly to each other, the choice of having to choose between them depends upon the user and neither outweighs the other.
